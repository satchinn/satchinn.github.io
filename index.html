      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Satchin Narasimhan. I was born and raised in San Jose, CA. I have 
            attended UC San Diego for the past 4 years, earning my B.S in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
        
        <p>I became interested in Control Systems during my third year of college when I took 
            an introductory course on LTI systems and basic control theory. I am eager to 
            explore more about Control Theory when I pursue my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.</p>

        <p>My latest experience was an internship at Solar Turbines, a Caterpillar Company. 
            This company designs and manufactures massive gas turbines connected to highly 
            pressurized compressors or power generators used in Power Generation or Oil & Gas applications.
            I was a Software Test Engineering Intern in the Custom Solutions department. There, I tested 
            the standard and custom software associated with real turbine engine packages 
            planned for Solar's customers. This entailed ensuring the electrical schematic, piping & instrumentation diagram,
            engine sprecifications, and ladder logic associated with starting, maintaining, and cooling the
            turbine engine all contained the correct pumps, sensors, actuators, transmitters, and I/O modules.
            Additionally, I ensured that the Human Machine Interface(HMI) interacted with the projects software
            properly and looked visually pleasing for the customers.

            </div>
            Overall, this internship was a wonderful experience. I learned about PLC programming and how to read complex
            ladder logic programs in order to find issues in the software.

        <h2>Integrated Magnetics</h2>

        <p>In the summer of 2023, I interned at Integrated Magnetics, a manifacturing company. For 10 weeks, I had the pleasure 
            of interning at Integrated Magnetics, a magnet manufacturing company. These specialized, high-grade magnets are used in 
            engineering industries varying from aerospace and defense to semiconductor manufacturing.

            I worked with several highly skilled employees with engineering, manufacturing, quality inspection, assembly, and testing. 
            It was a wonderful experience to work with these people. The knowledge and experience they have given me will forever be 
            remembered.
