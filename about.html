        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Satchin Narasimhan. I was born and raised in San Jose, CA. I have 
            attended UC San Diego for the past 4 years, earning my B.S in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
        
        <p>I became interested in Control Systems during my third year of college when I took 
            an introductory course on LTI systems and basic control theory. I am eager to 
            explore more about Control Theory when I pursue my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
        
        <h2>Past Experience</h2>

        <p>My latest experience was an internship at Solar Turbines, a Caterpillar Company. 
            This company designs and manufactures massive gas turbines connected to highly 
            pressurized compressors or power generators used in Power Generation or Oil & Gas applications.
            I was a Software Test Engineering Intern in the Custom Solutions department. There, I tested 
            the standard and custom software associated with real turbine engine packages 
            planned for Solar's customers. This entailed ensuring the electrical schematic, piping diagram,
            engine sprecifications, and ladder logic associated with starting, maintaining, and cooling the
            turbine engine all contained the correct pumps, sensors, actuators, transmitters, and I/O modules.
            Additionally, I ensured that the Human Machine Interface(HMI) interacted with the projects software
            properly and looked visually pleasing for the customers.

            Overall, this internship was a wonderful experience. I learned about PLC programming and how to read complex
            ladder logic programs in order to find issues in the software.
