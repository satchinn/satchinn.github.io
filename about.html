            attended UC San Diego for the past 4 years, earning my B.S in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
        
        <p>I became interested in Control Systems during my third year of college when I took 
            an introductory course on LTI systems and basic control theory. I am eager to 
            explore more about Control Theory when I pursue my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
        
        <h2>Past Experience</h2>

            This company designs and manufactures massive gas turbines connected to highly 
            pressurized compressors or power generators used in Oil & Gas applications.
            I am Software Test Engineering Intern in the Custom Solutions department. There, I tested 
            the standard and custom software associated with real turbine engine packages 
            planned for Solar's customers. This entailed I also  </p>
