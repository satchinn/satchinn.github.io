        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Satchin Narasimhan. I was born and raised in San Jose, CA. I have attended UC San Diego for the past 4 years, earning my B.S in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
        
        <p>I became interested in Control Systems during my third year of college when I took an introductory course on LTI systems and basic control theory. I am eager to explore more about Control Theory when I pursue my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering.</p>
