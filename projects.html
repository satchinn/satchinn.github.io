        <h2>Senior Capstone Project</h2>
        <p>
            I worked with 2 other engineering students, Kalie Garcia and Scott Ceklarz, to aid the research of Dr. Carlos Manuel Torres Jr.,
            a researcher at NIWC(Naval Information & Warfare Center) Pacific. His objective was to study the quantum engineering sub-field
            of Twistronics. This is the study of the opto-electronic effects of 2 dimensional materials stacked on top of each other and twisted
            at a certain angle. These resultant materials can be implemented into electronic devices to improve signal transmission for all radio
            frequencies. This was a wonderful learning experience, as this project dived more into nano-engineering than mechanical engineering.
            However, we were still able to incorporate aspects of mechanical engineering in our project.
